The standard contract terms used by traders, whether they are called ""terms and conditions"" or are part of a detailed contract that you may actually have to sign, have to be fair.

Under EU law, in order to be fair, standard contract terms may not create an imbalance in the rights and obligations of consumers on the one hand and sellers and suppliers on the other.

Legal explanation : Potentially unfair terms
Besides the general requirement of ""fairness"" and ""balance"", the EU rules contain a list of specific terms that may be judged unfair. If specific terms in a contract are unfair, they are not binding on consumers and the trader may not rely on them.

Terms which bind the consumer but allow traders to get out of providing a service just because it doesnt suit them.
Terms which allow a trader to keep pre-payments if the consumer cancels the contract without allowing for equivalent compensation to the consumer where the trader cancels.
Terms which allow a trader to dissolve a contract unilaterally but where the consumer does not enjoy the same right.
Terms which authorise a trader to terminate a contract with no fixed end-date at short notice, except where absolutely justified.
Terms whereby a consumer has to notify an intention to end such contracts but where the deadline for doing so is unreasonably early.
Terms which bind consumers even though they could not easily have been aware of them before signing the contract.
Terms which allow the trader to alter a contract unilaterally, unless the contract states a valid reason for doing so.
Terms where the trader can fix the final price on delivery or increase it, without giving consumers the option of cancelling the contract if the amount is much higher than initially agreed.
Terms where the trader alone has the right to interpret any clause of the contract and to decide whether the product or service complies with the contract.
Terms under which a trader tries to dodge commitments made by his staff or where such commitments are subject to other conditions.

03 Rental agreement - immovable property,Renter has unfair contract terms and claims these terms for resolution of issue,"Legal explanation : General rule
The standard contract terms used by traders, whether they are called ""terms and conditions"" or are part of a detailed contract that you may actually have to sign, have to be fair.

Under EU law, in order to be fair, standard contract terms may not create an imbalance in the rights and obligations of consumers on the one hand and sellers and suppliers on the other.

Legal explanation : Potentially unfair terms
Besides the general requirement of ""fairness"" and ""balance"", the EU rules contain a list of specific terms that may be judged unfair. If specific terms in a contract are unfair, they are not binding on consumers and the trader may not rely on them.

Terms which inappropriately exclude/limit consumers rights to compensation if the trader doesnt keep to his side of the contract.
Terms which bind the consumer but allow traders to get out of providing a service just because it doesnt suit them.
Terms which allow a trader to keep pre-payments if the consumer cancels the contract without allowing for equivalent compensation to the consumer where the trader cancels.
Terms which allow a trader to dissolve a contract unilaterally but where the consumer does not enjoy the same right.
Terms which authorise a trader to terminate a contract with no fixed end-date at short notice, except where absolutely justified.
Terms whereby a consumer has to notify an intention to end such contracts but where the deadline for doing so is unreasonably early.
Terms which bind consumers even though they could not easily have been aware of them before signing the contract.
Terms which allow the trader to alter a contract unilaterally, unless the contract states a valid reason for doing so.
Terms where the trader can fix the final price on delivery or increase it, without giving consumers the option of cancelling the contract if the amount is much higher than initially agreed.
Terms where the trader alone has the right to interpret any clause of the contract and to decide whether the product or service complies with the contract.
Terms under which a trader tries to dodge commitments made by his staff or where such commitments are subject to other conditions.
Terms obliging consumers to fulfil all their obligations when the trader doesnt abide by his.

The standard contract terms used by traders, whether they are called ""terms and conditions"" or are part of a detailed contract that you may actually have to sign, have to be fair.

Under EU law, in order to be fair, standard contract terms may not create an imbalance in the rights and obligations of consumers on the one hand and sellers and suppliers on the other.

Potentially unfair terms
Besides the general requirement of ""fairness"" and ""balance"", the EU rules contain a list of specific terms that may be judged unfair. If specific terms in a contract are unfair, they are not binding on consumers and the trader may not rely on them.

Terms which inappropriately exclude/limit consumers rights to compensation if the trader doesnt keep to his side of the contract.
Terms which bind the consumer but allow traders to get out of providing a service just because it doesnt suit them.
Terms which allow a trader to keep pre-payments if the consumer cancels the contract without allowing for equivalent compensation to the consumer where the trader cancels.
Terms which allow a trader to dissolve a contract unilaterally but where the consumer does not enjoy the same right.
Terms which authorise a trader to terminate a contract with no fixed end-date at short notice, except where absolutely justified.
Terms whereby a consumer has to notify an intention to end such contracts but where the deadline for doing so is unreasonably early.
Terms which bind consumers even though they could not easily have been aware of them before signing the contract.
Terms which allow the trader to alter a contract unilaterally, unless the contract states a valid reason for doing so.
Terms where the trader can fix the final price on delivery or increase it, without giving consumers the option of cancelling the contract if the amount is much higher than initially agreed.
Terms where the trader alone has the right to interpret any clause of the contract and to decide whether the product or service complies with the contract.

The standard contract terms used by traders, whether they are called ""terms and conditions"" or are part of a detailed contract that you may actually have to sign, have to be fair.

You must give your consent to any additional payment requested by the trader, for example express delivery, gift wrapping or travel insurance.

A trader is not permitted to charge you for these services unless you explicitly opted for them.

Using a pre-ticked box on the traders website does not constitute such consent and you would be entitled to reimbursement of any payment which has been collected in such a way.

Surcharges : fees for the use of cards and other means of payment
If a trader wishes to surcharge you for using a specific means of payment - for instance a credit card - then the fee cannot be higher than what it actually costs him to process your payment. In some countries such surcharges may be banned altogether.

The standard contract terms used by traders, whether they are called ""terms and conditions"" or are part of a detailed contract that you may actually have to sign, have to be fair.
